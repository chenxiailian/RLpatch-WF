The paper code
We are in the process of preparing the code and relevant documentation for release. 

Datasets
We sincerely thank the authors for sharing their dataset. Two public real-world datasets used in our experiments are listed as follows:

Deep Fingerprinting: It contains 95 websites, each with 1,000 undefended traces, for closed-world evaluation. Excluding the 95 websites, it also includes 40,000 websites for open-world evaluation, each with only 1 undefended trace. This dataset is provided by Rahman et al., and you can find the dataset on the google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kxjqlaWWJbMW56E3kbXlttqcKJFkeCy6?usp=sharing

AWF: It consists of the first 100 monitored websites from the Alexa Top sites, where each website has 2,500 samples.
